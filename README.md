# forkify Project

The app uses the Food2Fork website API to search for and display recipe information, as well as Local Storage to store recipe data. Users can select recipes they like and add them to their "favorites," as well as create their own shopping lists based on the ingredients needed for each recipe.
In this app I used several libraries like "Fracty", "Parcel". I also used a SASS for CSS. I tried to make the architecture similar to React application with 'imports" / "exports" and Functions, like React Components.

About App:

- The app uses the Food2Fork website API.
- The user can search any recipe in search bar
- I've added pagination if there are more than 10 search results.
- To display the recipe, the user can click on the recipe and see the description.
- All the ingredients depends on servings number (user can change it)
- User can bookmark recipes by clicking on bookmark and got than recipe bookmark in header
- Recipe in bookmark can displaying by clickig on recipe
- Unbookmarking is also available
- In addition, the user can add a recipe by clicking on the button and filling out the form. All recipes that you upload yourself will be visible only to you (marked with an icon). User can find your recipe by searching like others
