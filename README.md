# JS-Forkify-App

This application is all about searching for recipes and dispaying them, in user interface. In this app I used several libraries like "Fracty", "Parcel". I also used a SASS for CSS. I tried to make the architecture similar to React application with 'imports" / "exports" and Functions, like React Components.
